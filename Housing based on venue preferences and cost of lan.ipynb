In order to have a more logistic approximation to the decision of where to buy a house, in this study I want to propose an initial approximation that takes into account the venue\u2019s preferences of a person, and the average land prices of each neighborhood in a city.</p>\n</br>\n<p>In order to  choose a house the most important characteristics persons consider based on the study of House Repay (https://www.fastrepayhomeloan.com.au/7-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-house/) are:\nLocation:</p>\n</br>\n<p>-Neighborhood</p>\n<p>-Schools and Colleges</p>\n<p>-Infrastructure (transportation, connectivity with other neighborhoods)</p>\n<p>-Crime (crime index)</p>\n<p>-House inspection</p>\n<p>-Green open space</p>\n</br>\n<p>In this evaluation, the objective will be to produce personalized results based on preferences of a given person, this means the previously described factors will be grouped in order to simplify the process of determining the best locations that accomplish the preferences of a person, and the price per square foot on each neighborhood will be included. Additionally, since the information will be at the neighborhood level, specific data like location and house inspection not will be included. The information about venues will be based on personal preferences this means schools/colleges and green spaces will be important only in those cases in which the persons consider this as an important preference. Finally, crime data and infrastructure data not will be included since they are considered out of the scope of this project, but future versions of the model can be included in order to refine the result of the model.</p>"
